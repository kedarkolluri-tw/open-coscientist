# AI Co-Scientist: Multi-Agent Scientific Discovery System

A comprehensive implementation of the AI co-scientist concept from Google DeepMind's research, built using LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration. This system automates and accelerates scientific discovery through collaborative AI agents that generate, critique, rank, and evolve scientific hypotheses.

## 🧬 System Overview

The AI co-scientist employs a "generate, debate, and evolve" approach with specialized agents working together:

- **Generation Agents**: Create novel scientific hypotheses through literature synthesis and simulated debates
- **Reflection Agents**: Critically review hypotheses for correctness, novelty, and feasibility  
- **Ranking Agents**: Run ELO-based tournaments to identify the most promising ideas
- **Evolution Agents**: Refine and improve top-ranked hypotheses
- **Proximity Agents**: Analyze hypothesis similarity and cluster related ideas
- **Meta-review Agents**: Synthesize findings into comprehensive research overviews
- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates the entire multi-agent research process

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd open-coscientist-agents

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from coscientist.framework import CoScientistFramework
from coscientist.configuration import goal_to_configuration
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize with your LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
framework = CoScientistFramework(llm)

# Define your research goal
research_goal = """
Develop a novel hypothesis for treating Alzheimer's disease 
by targeting protein aggregation mechanisms.
"""

# Generate research configuration
research_config = goal_to_configuration(llm, research_goal)

# Run the AI co-scientist system
async def run_research():
    results = await framework.run_framework(
        goal=research_goal,
        research_plan_config=research_config,
        max_iterations=10
    )
    return results

# Execute the research process
results = asyncio.run(run_research())
print(results["research_overview"])
```

### Development Setup

#### Installing Development Dependencies
```bash
# Install the package with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks Setup
This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. The hooks automatically run `ruff check --select I` (import sorting) and `ruff format` on all changed files.

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Optionally, run hooks on all files manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The pre-commit configuration includes:
- **Import sorting**: Automatically organizes imports using ruff with `--select I` flag
- **Code formatting**: Ensures consistent formatting with ruff format

If the hooks fail, they will automatically fix most issues. Simply stage the changes and commit again:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
