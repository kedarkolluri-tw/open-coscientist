# AI Co-Scientist: Multi-Agent Scientific Discovery System

A comprehensive implementation of the AI co-scientist concept from Google DeepMind's research, built using LangGraph for multi-agent orchestration. This system automates and accelerates scientific discovery through collaborative AI agents that generate, critique, rank, and evolve scientific hypotheses.

Still under construction, but nearly there.
