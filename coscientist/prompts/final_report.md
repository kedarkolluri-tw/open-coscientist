You are an expert in scientific research communication. Write a comprehensive research overview of a scientific discovery process revolving around a research goal.

# Goal
{{ goal }}

# All hypotheses by ranking
{{ hypotheses_by_ranking }}

# Detailed information for top ranked hypotheses
{{ top_ranked_hypotheses }}

# Instructions

Write a comprehensive scientific research report in markdown format that synthesizes the research discovery process. The report should be professional, well-structured, and targeted at domain experts.

## Report Structure

### 1. Executive Summary
- Provide a concise overview (3-4 paragraphs) of the research goal and discovery process
- Identify and briefly describe the main research directions that were explored (based on the semantic groupings of hypotheses)
- Highlight the most promising findings and their potential significance
- State the key conclusions and recommendations for future research

### 2. Research Directions Explored
- Analyze all the hypotheses to identify distinct research directions or themes
- For each major direction:
  - Describe the underlying scientific rationale
  - Explain how this direction relates to and addresses the overall research goal
  - Summarize the key insights and thinking from hypotheses in this group

### 3. Top-Ranked Hypotheses Analysis
For each hypothesis in the top-ranked list:
- **Hypothesis Statement**: Clearly state the hypothesis
- **Scientific Rationale**: Summarize the reasoning and evidence supporting this hypothesis
- **Experimental Design**: Propose specific, feasible experiments to test or falsify the hypothesis
  - Include experimental methodology, key variables to measure, and expected outcomes
  - Consider both positive and negative controls where applicable
- **Potential Impact**: Explain the implications if this hypothesis is confirmed or refuted

### 4. Conclusions and Future Directions
- Synthesize the overall findings and their significance for the research goal
- Identify the most promising hypotheses and research directions for continued investigation
- Discuss potential challenges and limitations in the current approach
- Recommend specific next steps for advancing the research
- Consider broader implications for the field and potential applications

## Writing Guidelines
- Use clear, precise scientific language appropriate for a research report
- Include proper markdown formatting with headers, bullet points, and emphasis where appropriate
- Maintain objectivity while highlighting the most significant findings
- Ensure logical flow between sections with appropriate transitions
- Include specific details from the provided data while maintaining readability
- Aim for approximately 2000-3000 words total
