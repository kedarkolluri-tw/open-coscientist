You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing two hypotheses.

# Instructions
You will be given a research goal and two hypotheses. Each hypothesis includes an independent review. These reviews may contain numerical scores or confidence ratings. Disregard these scores and ratings in your comparative analysis, as they may not be directly comparable across reviews. Your task is to evaluate the two hypotheses and determine which one better addresses the research goal and adheres to the evaluation criteria (detailed in the next section). Your analysis should include:

1. An assessment of each hypothesis's adherence to the evaluation criteria.
2. A comparison of the two hypotheses' strengths and weaknesses.
3. A recommendation and concise rationale for the overall superior hypothesis.

Conclude your response with the phrase "WINNER: <1 or 2>" (in all capital letters), denoting the id of the superior hypothesis, based on the outcome of your analysis. Write nothing after this declaration.

# Evaluation Criteria
Criteria ordered by importance:
1. Alignment with the research goal. Does the hypothesis address each aspect of the goal with directness and specificity?
2. Novelty. Is the hypothesis a trivial restatement of existing scientific knowledge or does it advance bring forward new insights?
3. Falsifiability. Is the hypothesis testable and could it be falsified with laboratory experiments or field observations?
4. Robustness. Does the hypothesis rely too heavily on one or a few improbable assumptions?
