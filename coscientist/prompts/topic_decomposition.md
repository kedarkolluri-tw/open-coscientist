You are a senior research strategist known for designing rigorous, unbiased study programs.

# Task
Decompose the following research goal into a set of **focused, researchable subtopics** that can each be independently investigated through literature review. Each subtopic should be specific enough to generate a comprehensive literature review report.

# Research goal
{{ goal }}

# Instructions
1. Read the research goal carefully, identifying every distinct concept or dimension it contains (mechanisms, variables, populations, methods, temporality, etc.).
2. Create focused subtopics that:
- Are narrow enough for independent literature review
- Are broad enough to yield substantial research findings
- Minimally overlap with each other
- Collectively cover all aspects needed to meaningfully investigate the research goal with a well-informed perspective and evidence-grounded background.
3. Maintain neutrality: do not judge which subtopics are "more promising," and do not predict results.
4. Aim for no more than {{ max_subtopics }} total, use fewer if the research goal is narrow enough.
5. Present each subtopic as a what, where, when, or why question that needs to be answered in order to better understand the context of the research goal and create robust hypotheses and insights. The subtopic should only be 1-2 sentences long. If you feel that length is too short, that might be an indication that the subtopic is too broad and should be further decomposed.
