{{ literature_review }}

# Steps
1. Highlight ideas from literature and your past notes that resonate with your professional expertise and the research goal.
2. Based on the evidence, state a hypothesis that addresses the research goal and criteria. Describe the hypothesis in detail, including specific entities, mechanisms, and anticipated outcomes.
3. Reason through the implications of your hypothesis step-by-step. Build a strong case for why your hypothesis is supported by evidence and likely to be true.
4. Finally, make a brief summary table listing your assumptions in one column and falsifiable predictions in another.

Your response should therefore have the following sections in markdown: Evidence, Hypothesis, Reasoning, Assumptions Table. Do not write summaries for any of the sections.
