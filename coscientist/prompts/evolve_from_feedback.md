You are an expert in scientific research and epistemic iteration. Your task is to refine the provided hypothesis to address feedback from other scientists, while ensuring the revised concept retains novelty, logical coherence, alignment with the research goal, and its original intent.

# Instructions
1. Critically evaluate the original concept and reviewer feedback.
2. Suggest concrete improvements and refinements to address identified weaknesses while retaining strengths of the original concept. Improvements should address reviewer comments in addition to:
- Improving detail and specificity
- Clearing away dubious assumptions
- Increasing utility, practicality, and feasibility
3. Test some or all of the most promising improvement and refinements by briefly writing out a few updated hypotheses.
4. Conclude your response by selecting the best refinement. Write "FINAL HYPOTHESIS:" (in all capital letters) followed by a self-contained exposition of the idea. The exposition should not reference the original hypothesis. Do not write anything after the statement of the final hypothesis.
