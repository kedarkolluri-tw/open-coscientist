            ## Evidence
            ALS is characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration. Recent studies show nuclear pore complex dysfunction in ALS models.
            
            ## Hypothesis
            Hyperphosphorylation of nucleoporin Nup62 by stress-activated kinases disrupts nuclear transport selectivity, leading to toxic protein accumulation and motor neuron death in ALS.
            
            ## Reasoning
            Nuclear pore complexes control molecular traffic between nucleus and cytoplasm. Nup62 is a key component for transport selectivity. Stress conditions in ALS could activate kinases that phosphorylate Nup62, compromising transport function.

            | Assumption | Evidence Level | Testability |
            |------------|----------------|-------------|

            # Research Overview: ALS and Nuclear Pore Complex Dysfunction
            
            ## Executive Summary
            This research investigation identified novel mechanistic hypotheses linking nuclear pore complex (NPC) dysfunction to ALS pathogenesis, with particular focus on nucleoporin phosphorylation.
            
            ## Key Hypotheses
            
            ### Top-Ranked Hypothesis: Nup62 Hyperphosphorylation
            **Core Mechanism:** Stress-activated kinases hyperphosphorylate nucleoporin Nup62, disrupting nuclear transport selectivity and causing toxic protein accumulation in motor neurons.
            
            **Strengths:**
            - Novel and testable mechanism
            - Strong biological rationale
            - Clear experimental pathway
            
            ## Recommended Next Steps
            
            ### Immediate Experiments (6-12 months)
            1. **Phosphorylation Analysis:** Mass spectrometry analysis of Nup62 phosphorylation in ALS patient samples vs. controls
            2. **Functional Assays:** Nuclear transport assays using phosphorylation-mimetic Nup62 mutants
            3. **Kinase Identification:** Proteomics screen to identify kinases responsible for Nup62 phosphorylation
            
            ### Medium-term Studies (1-2 years)
            1. **Animal Models:** Test hypothesis in ALS mouse models
            2. **Drug Screening:** Screen for kinase inhibitors that prevent Nup62 hyperphosphorylation
            3. **Biomarker Development:** Validate Nup62 phosphorylation as ALS biomarker
            
            ## Knowledge Gaps
            - Specific kinases involved in Nup62 phosphorylation
            - Temporal progression of NPC dysfunction in ALS
            - Reversibility of transport defects
            
            ## Suggested Collaborations
            - Nuclear transport experts (e.g., Görlich lab, MPI)
            - ALS researchers with patient samples
            - Kinase biology specialists
            - Drug discovery teams
            
            ## Risk Assessment
            **High Risk:** Limited evidence for Nup62 phosphorylation in ALS
            **Medium Risk:** Technical challenges in transport assays
            **Low Risk:** Basic biological concepts well-established
            
            ## Funding Opportunities
            - NIH R01 for mechanism studies
            - ALS Association grants for translational research
            - European Research Council for innovative approaches

🔬 What Just Happened?

The AI Co-Scientist system demonstrated its multi-agent approach:

1. **Generation Agents** created novel hypotheses about ALS and NPC dysfunction
2. **Reflection Agents** critically reviewed hypotheses for quality and feasibility  
3. **Ranking Agents** ran tournaments to identify the most promising ideas
4. **Evolution Agents** refined top hypotheses and generated new variants
5. **Proximity Agents** analyzed similarity between hypotheses
6. **Meta-review Agents** synthesized findings into actionable research plans
7. **Supervisor Agent** orchestrated the entire process

The system used LangGraph for workflow management, enabling:
- Asynchronous task execution
- Multi-agent collaboration  
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Iterative hypothesis refinement

In a real deployment, this would connect to:
- Live literature databases (PubMed, Google Scholar)
- Advanced LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
- Specialized scientific tools
- Collaborative research platforms

🚀 Next Steps:
- Explore the generated hypotheses
- Review the session data in the database
- Modify the research goal and run again
- Integrate with real LLMs and databases
