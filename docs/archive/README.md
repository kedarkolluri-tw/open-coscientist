# Archive: Historical Documents

This folder contains archived documents that are no longer actively used but are kept for historical reference.

## What's Here

- **ACTUAL_LANGGRAPH_ANALYSIS.md**: Initial LangGraph architecture analysis (superseded by COMPLETE_DATA_FLOW.md)
- **CORRECTED_LANGGRAPH_DIAGRAMS.md**: Various Mermaid diagram attempts that were consolidated
- **CRITICAL_ISSUES_ACTION_PLAN.md**: Documented issues and action plans from development discussions

## Why Archive?

These documents were created during architecture analysis and represent "conversation history" rather than active planning. They capture important decisions and analysis but are not part of the current documentation.

## Notes

- Files here are kept for historical context only
- Current documentation is in `docs/architecture/`
- Active planning documents are in `docs/TODO/`
