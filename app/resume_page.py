        **Before resuming:**
        - Make sure the research goal is not already completed
        - Check that no other process is currently running for this goal
        - Review the current state information to understand progress
        
        **During resume:**
        - The process runs in the background - you can navigate to other pages
        - Use the refresh button to check status updates
        - Check the Tournament Rankings page to see new results as they appear
        
        **After completion:**
        - View results in the Tournament Rankings page
        - Explore hypothesis relationships in the Proximity Graph page
        - Results are automatically saved and can be viewed later
